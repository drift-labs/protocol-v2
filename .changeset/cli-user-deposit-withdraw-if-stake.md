Add `user deposit`, `user withdraw`, and `if stake` commands to the admin CLI, usable directly or through a Squads V4 multisig (`--multisig` defaults the authority to the vault 0 PDA so the proposal executes with the vault as signer). SDK: `getWithdrawIx`, `getInitializeInsuranceFundStakeIx`, and `getAddInsuranceFundStakeIx` now accept an optional `overrides.authority`, matching `getDepositInstruction`, so instructions can be built for an authority other than the wallet (e.g. a multisig vault PDA).
